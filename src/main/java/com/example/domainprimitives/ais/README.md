# AIS Domain Primitives

This package contains domain primitives for AIS (Automatic Identification System). AIS is a system used for tracking
ships. The structure of the messages are strictly regulated as they are being used all over the world. It therefore
makes sense to create domain primitives for the different messages and data types, and to make sure that
the data conforms to the AIS requirements.

The classes have been copied from this example project: https://github.com/v5-architecture-study-group/ais-demo/
